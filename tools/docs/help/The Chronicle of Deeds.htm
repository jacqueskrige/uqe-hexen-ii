        face="Garamond">It was precisely one year ago that
        Eidolon came to our world of Thyrion. On the evening
        before his arrival, a rain of fire streamed down from the
        sky, scorching citizens and buildings alike on the four
        continents of our fair planet. By dawn the populace was
        fearful and demoralized, and they fell quickly before the
        march of Eidolon&#146;s vile Golems. The attack was bold
        and carefully executed. All four continents had fallen by
        midday: a sad tribute to the withered resistance of our
        four mighty nations. Even now I am shamed to think of it.</font><p><font
        face="Garamond">Now, a full year after the conquest,
        Thyrion still huddles in a state of constant fear and
        dread. The conquest has ended, and many humans yet
        survive&#150;but in these times of trouble, life itself
        is a meager blessing. Eidolon&#146;s minions overrun the
        land and kill its populace for sport. The cleverest
        humans make themselves unobtrusive, avoiding
        Eidolon&#146;s creatures and attempting little more than
        to survive. It is under these dreary conditions that I
        write the manuscript you now hold in your hands.</font></p>

        align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="327"
        height="400"></font><font face="Garamond">Several hundred
        years ago, in the time we now call the Age of Dreams,
        there were rumors of the Serpent Riders. The Serpent
        Riders were a trio of horrifying demons, wielding
        powerful magic and commanding vast, formidable armies.
        They possessed the power to travel from world to
        world&#150;and everywhere they went, they spread chaos
        and despair. Their motives were unclear, but their goals
        were obvious: they wished to possess. That which they
        could not possess, they strove to destroy. No world was
        immune, not even our beloved Thyrion.</font><p><font
        face="Garamond">So went the rumors, but few took heed.
        Some dismissed them as the ravings of a madman, or as
        fairy tales told to frighten children. Others disputed
        the very foundation of the stories, denying the existence
        of worlds beyond our own. And still others took comfort
        in obscurity: if other worlds did indeed exist, why
        should the Serpent Riders trouble themselves with
        Thyrion?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Garamond">How naïve, in retrospect, were
        our great civilizations. The portents were numerous and
        easily read, but none&#150;not even I, Sage of
        Mur&#150;gave them more than a cursory glance. And now we
        have paid for our ignorance, as all that was prophesied
        has come to pass. The four great continents of our world
        have been overrun by demonic hordes, their denizens
        crushed, scattered, and cruelly enslaved. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Garamond">Our world is, by any measure,
        utterly lost&#150;and yet I cannot bring myself to
        believe it. Despite all that I have seen, I assure myself
        that salvation is yet possible. To this end I write the
        volume you now see before you. It is a history of the
        Serpent Riders&#146; assault on our world, and,
        hopefully, the counterattack that will free us of their
        dominion.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Garamond">At present time, the populace
        has little fuel for hope. None have risen to challenge
        the dark armies of Eidolon. Still, I continue to maintain
        my faith. In dreams and visions I have seen a band of
        unlikely saviors, a defiant flicker in the darkness that
        cloaks our world. Who these heroes are, I cannot
        say&#150;but I shall present my visions in the pages of
        this chronicle.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Garamond">My visions, in fact, are our
        only reason for hope. They suggest an end to
        Eidolon&#146;s reign, and the possibility of our
        world&#146;s restoration. Instead of calling this history
        The Fall of Thyrion, therefore, I have named it The
        Chronicle of Deeds, after the deeds of unknown warriors
        that will hopefully save us all. These deeds may never be
        realized, but I steadfastly maintain that they
        must&#150;for I shudder to think of the alternative. </font></p>

        face="Garamond">In ages past, the steppe dwellers of
        Kazul-Mokh prophesied the coming of Eidolon and his
        brethren. But to understand their stories, one must first
        understand their view of the universe. </font><p><font
        face="Garamond">In the steppe dwellers&#146; eyes,
        Thyrion is just one of many worlds. The other worlds of
        our universe appear as stars in the evening sky. By the
        steppe dwellers&#146; reckoning, there are precisely one
        thousand worlds besides our own, each appearing a single
        brilliant star. But this view of the universe posits many
        questions. What lies between the stars? What holds each
        world in place?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Garamond">According to the steppe
        dwellers, the universe is filled with a clear but viscous
        gas known as Aether. The Aether is to the universe what
        water is to the ocean; it holds the stars in place, and
        fills the void between them. A great crystal sphere
        encircles the Aether, preventing it from escaping. Beyond
        this celestial sphere lies darkness: the very darkness we
        see when the sun sinks below the horizon. This darkness
        is an uncharted land of powerful demons and evil spirits,
        each slavering to crush our petty worlds, but prevented
        by the great crystal barrier.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Garamond">The steppe dwellers tell of a
        brilliant magician who, seeking to travel to distant
        worlds, fashioned a ship of ironwood and silver to
        journey through the Aether. When the ship was complete he
        climbed aboard and sailed into the night, just as a
        mariner would take to the seas. The journey proceeded
        smoothly for countless days, but then disaster struck:
        the ship&#146;s gossamer sails were torn in a great storm
        of Aether. Unable to steer or otherwise control his
        craft, the helpless magician watched his ship glide past
        the brilliant stars he had hoped to visit. Closer and
        closer loomed the celestial sphere, and the darkness
        beyond; the magician watched it approach with a mixture
        of dread and fascination. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Garamond">Finally, the magical ship
        collided with the barrier. The vessel&#146;s silver prow
        punctured the crystal sphere and cracked it open,
        allowing a trio of demons from the darkness beyond to
        slip into our universe. Horrified at the tragedy he had
        caused, the magician worked a final, mighty spell to
        close the rift, exchanging his life for the power to seal
        the cosmic barrier. He died quietly in the darkness
        between worlds, wondering if our universe would survive
        the terror he had unleashed. He would never know the
        answer, and neither, yet, do we.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Garamond">So goes the story. Whether truth
        or fiction, it remains our best guess as to the origin of
        the Serpent Riders. Many have dismissed this tale as mere
        superstition, but I choose to believe it. Why? Just as
        the steppe dwellers foretold the arrival of the Serpent
        Riders, they also foretold the trio&#146;s demise. For
        this reason alone, I fervently hope their prophecies are
        correct.</font></p>

        </strong></font><font face="Garamond">According to the
        texts of Yavenar the Astromancer, the Serpent
        Riders&#146; first attack occurred two thousand years
        ago, on a remote world whose name is forever lost. This
        world was a place of dense population and seven mighty
        nations. The Serpent Riders subjugated the world&#146;s
        seven great leaders by trickery and guile, for they had
        not yet attained their full power in this universe, and
        could not crush the world through forthright aggression.
        One by one the nations fell, as if by clockwork; their
        corruption and decayed traditions had left them
        vulnerable to the Serpent Riders&#146; deception.</font><p><font
        face="Garamond">When the seven great nations had been
        subverted, they were left to fight amongst themselves.
        D&#146;Sparil, the youngest and weakest of the Serpent
        Riders, was left behind to act as puppeteer. He gleefully
        pulled the strings of each nation, pitting former allies
        against each other, and sending peaceful nations to
        battle. He planned to continue this cruel game until
        every nation had collapsed under the weight of war and
        famine. The two elders, meanwhile, departed. It was their
        intention to wreak havoc in new and unsuspecting worlds.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Garamond">Only the Sidhe, a race of
        heretical elves hiding in the secret places of the world,
        were left untouched by the Serpent Riders&#146; poison.
        Recognizing the threat to their world, the Sidhe elders
        contrived a mighty spell that crushed the greatest of the
        Serpent Riders&#146; armies, leaving behind only a
        fraction of the mighty horde. But D&#146;Sparil, sensing
        the source of the magic, retaliated with a storm of pure
        energy that killed the elders to a man. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Garamond">In the wake of this great
        magical battle, with the world apparently withered beyond
        salvation, a single nameless Sidhe assaulted
        D&#146;Sparil&#146;s stronghold: The City of the Damned.
        Using the Sidhe elders&#146; Tomes of Power, mighty
        artifacts that enhanced the properties of his weapons,
        this lone elf scored an improbable victory against the
        forces of evil. D&#146;Sparil was crushed and his minions
        killed or scattered. Though merely a shadow of its former
        self, the world was finally free of the Serpent
        Riders&#146; poisonous influence. </font></p>

        </strong></font><font face="Garamond">The next target of
        the Serpent Riders&#146; wrath was Cronos, a populous
        human world. Cronos was a land of unification and
        oppression, where all of humanity bowed to the
        triumvirate of Legion, Arcanum, and Church. These three
        institutions controlled every aspect of Cronos, each
        exerting power over a meticulously defined sphere of
        influence. As such, Cronos was both disciplined and
        fragile: by subverting the leaders of these three
        institutions, the Serpent Riders instantly gained control
        of the entire world. Zedek, Marshal of the Legion,
        Traductus, Grand Patriarch of the Church, and Menelkir,
        Arch-Mage of the Arcanum succumbed quickly to the Serpent
        Riders&#146; promises of immortal life.</font><p><font
        face="Garamond">As before, a single Serpent Rider was
        left behind once the world was largely enslaved. This
        time it was Korax, the second most powerful Serpent
        Rider. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Garamond">On Cronos there was no such
        thing as the Sidhe, no secret conclave to expunge
        Korax&#146;s grand army. But there were three brave souls
        who fought against Korax&#146;s might: Baratus of the
        Legion, Parius of the Church, and Daedolon of the
        Arcanum. Together, these three adventurers fought their
        way through the twisted realms of Cronos, ultimately
        defeating the chitinous horror that was Korax. Their
        victory marked a grand day for all of humanity, once
        again signaling the vulnerability of the dreaded Serpent
        Riders. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Garamond"><strong>Eidolon<br>
</strong></font><font face="Garamond">Eidolon&#146;s power is
immense, his grip on our world absolute. Some citizens believe
his hellish reign must come to an end, and look to the improbable
victories against D&#146;Sparil and Korax for inspiration. But
for most, the future is uncompromisingly bleak. Eidolon, the
oldest and strongest of the Serpent Riders, is reputedly many
times more powerful than his vile brethren. He is certainly aware
of the weaknesses that led to the downfall of D&#146;Sparil and
Korax, and will do his best to guard himself against similar
circumstances. Indeed, he has already taken such measures: in
addition to his own troops, he has surrounded himself with the
remnants of Korax&#146;s and D&#146;Sparil&#146;s broken armies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">The task at hand is formidable. Whoever
challenges Eidolon must destroy his minions on all four
continents, then challenge Eidolon himself within his ebon
stronghold. The dangers are great, from beginning to end. The
dank jungles of Mazaera seethe with giant Scorpions and Spiders,
while the pyramids of Thysis are replete with Mummies and dreaded
Stone Golems. No less formidable are the horrors lurking in the
ruined cities of Septimus, or behind the crenelated walls of
Blackmarsh. </font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Despite all these travails, there is yet
another peril: the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, who serve
Eidolon as generals. Each governs one of the four great nations,
and each must be defeated to end Eidolon&#146;s infernal
dominion. Can any hero, however powerful, face all these perils
and emerge victorious? Only time will tell.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="The Lands of Thyrion"><font size="5" face="Garamond"><strong>The
Lands of Thyrion </strong></font></a></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">What challenges and perils await those
who would strive against Eidolon&#146;s might? Aside from
Eidolon&#146;s ravening armies, the land itself presents
formidable challenges. For those unfamiliar with Thyrion, I will
now present a brief introduction.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Garamond"><strong>Continents<br>
</strong></font><font face="Garamond">Any hero wishing to clear
the land of Eidolon&#146;s minions must visit all four of
Thyrion&#146;s great continents: Blackmarsh, Mazaera, Thysis and
Septimus. These lands all possess their own unique perils and
challenges, many of which are unknown even to me. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><strong>Blackmarsh<br>
</strong></font><font face="Garamond">A land of cold rain and
dark, decaying castles, Blackmarsh appears harsh and uninviting
to the casual visitor. It has become even less so since the
coming of Eidolon: once-quaint villages and fortresses have now
been overrun with Golems, Fallen Angels, and a host of other vile
creatures.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Any hero wishing to rid Blackmarsh of
evil would have to fight his or her way through several distinct
locales: the Grand Cathedral, the Underhalls, the Mage&#146;s
Tower, and more. Eidolon&#146;s minions have also infested the
sewers beneath Blackmarsh&#146;s greatest cities&#150;and these,
too, must be expunged of their evil denizens.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Eidolon&#146;s inner sanctum is rumored
to lie somewhere within the lands of Blackmarsh, though none can
attest to this with any certainty.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><strong>Mazaera<br>
</strong></font><font face="Garamond">Mazaera is a land of lush
rain forests and nomadic tribesmen. A few scattered centers of
civilization have been carved from the heart of Mazaera&#146;s
steamy jungles, but the remainder of the continent remains
largely untouched by man.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Mazaera is filled with the ruins of
ancient civilizations, many of which have now been claimed by
Eidolon. The legendary Plaza of the Sun, Court of 1,000 Warriors,
and Tomb of the High Priest are all famous sites long since
overrun by vile beasts. Perhaps the most formidable of these
creatures is the lithe and deadly Were Jaguar, which makes its
home exclusively in Mazaera&#146;s warm climate. Adventurers
beware!</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond"><strong>Thysis<br>
</strong>Thysis is a continent dominated by desert: only the land
adjoining the coast shows signs of abundant vegetation. Within
this barren desert, several great empires have risen and
crumbled&#150;despite the apparent hardships of living in such a
hostile climate.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">The distinctive culture of Thysis has
always seemed unusual to denizens of other continents, and is
shrouded with even more mystery since the coming of Eidolon. The
great pyramids of Thysis, both whole and ruined, have been
conquered by hordes of Mummies and Golems. The fantastical Palace
of Horus and the forbidding Temple of Set have likewise fallen to
Eidolon&#146;s inexorable onslaught. Only the mightiest of heroes
will succeed in this strange, hostile land, where Scorpions run
rampant, and sealed tombs conceal horrors beyond mortal
imagination.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><strong>Septimus<br>
</strong></font><font face="Garamond">The most heavily populated
of Thyrion&#146;s four continents, Septimus is a land of urban
decadence. Its citizens are cosmopolitan, sampling the best that
Thyrion has to offer from the comfort of their richly appointed
palaces.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Unfortunately, the wealth and comfort of
Septimus bred complacency and sloth. Aside from the ascetic
devotees of Kravnos, Septimus&#146; citizens were ill prepared
for the coming of Eidolon. Septimus&#146; grand structures fell
within hours of Eidolon&#146;s initial assault: the grand Forum,
the multitudinous temples, the famous bath houses and hanging
gardens. All these grand locales were conquered in record time,
and Septimus&#146; citizens were forced to watch their carefully
built cities reduced to ruins overnight.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Eidolon&#146;s minions keep a
particularly strong vigil over Septimus, due to its wealth and
importance in the workings of Thyrion. Led by deadly Medusas,
these armies will present a formidable challenge to even the
mightiest champion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Garamond"><strong>Hazards and
Peculiarities of Thyrion<br>
</strong></font><font face="Garamond">As the reader may not be
familiar with the lands of Thyrion, I shall endeavor to describe
the perils and peculiarities that are found throughout our lands.
Monsters are not the only challenge to face a would-be hero; the
land itself is replete with untold dangers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond"><strong>Precipices<br>
</strong>Thyrion is a land of steep precipices and narrow gorges.
In many cases Eidolon&#146;s minions have used this feature to
their advantage, occupying fortresses riddled with dangerous
drops, and forcing would-be heroes to brave these perils before
challenging the fortress&#146; occupants.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond"><strong>Rivers and Lakes<br>
</strong>Rivers and lakes are scattered across the world of
Thyrion. Just as Eidolon&#146;s minions have chosen to take
residence near dangerous heights, so too have they staked out
lairs where water is close at hand. Thanks to the swarms of
deadly Hydrae inhabiting Thyrion&#146;s murky waters, the
presence of lakes or pools is often of great defensive value to
Eidolon.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond"><strong>Lava<br>
</strong>Though uncommon, volcanic eruptions have been known to
strike all across Thyrion. In certain cases, daring architects
have sought to funnel molten lava through their palaces and
tombs, either for decorative or defensive value. </font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Even the hardiest of adventurers cannot
withstand the heat of this lava; falling into a pit of the stuff
is almost certain death.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond"><strong>Traps<br>
</strong>Eidolon&#146;s creatures have devised any number of
diabolical traps and snares to catch the unwary adventurer. Many
of these traps involve falling sections of ceiling, magical fire
that gouts from the walls, or floors that give way to sheer drops
or superheated lava. These traps are so varied that I cannot list
every sort: suffice it to say that a hero must be cautious when
infiltrating Eidolon&#146;s strongholds, for all manner of traps
are likely to abound.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond"><strong>Teleporters<br>
</strong>There is a final feature of Thyrion that bears
mentioning. Unlike the others, it is not a hazard.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">I refer, of course, to the network of
teleporters erected by Thyrion&#146;s mages many years ago. These
teleporters connect important points on each of the four
continents, and in some cases, connect the continents themselves.
Using these teleporters is as simple as walking through a door.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Teleporters will be crucial to the fight
against Eidolon, for they allow free movement among his most
pivotal strongholds. Any adventurer seeking to destroy Eidolon
would do well to locate nearby teleporters and use them to best
effect.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">In the year since Eidolon&#146;s first
conquest, many strange and deadly creatures have stalked

        </strong>Eidolon&#146;s minions include a number of human

        favor the cadres of deadly archers who heed his beck and

        <p><font face="Garamond">Knight Archers fire enchanted
        arrows of two varieties. The standard Archer arrow emits
        a greenish glow and deals considerable damage to its
        target. The alternate type of arrow glows luminous red,
        and knocks the archer&#146;s foes backward with great
        force while causing an equal amount of damage as the
        green arrows. These red arrows are deadly tools, as they
        allow the Archer to buffet nearby foes back to long

        particular types on each continent. The mid-sized Iron
        Golem, a ponderous creature of iron and lead, plagues the
        castles of Blackmarsh and jungles of Mazaera. Deadly and
        massive Bronze Golems tread the paved streets of
        Septimus, while the relatively diminutive Stone Golems
        prowl amongst the pyramids of Thysis.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Garamond">All Golems love hand-to-hand

        <p><font face="Garamond">The main challenge in fighting
        Golems is to deal enough damage to destroy them. There

        important than power. Wielding long scepters to good
        advantage, Mummies tend to have the upper hand when
        fighting in their natural environs. When their foes
        retreat to greater distances, however, the Mummy is by no

        when an opponent draws too close.</font><p><font

</strong>Magic of all kinds is powered by an intangible essence
called mana. Mana suffuses the earth and flows in the wind, but
humans are incapable of tapping into this mana directly. To
harness this mystical energy, magi capture it in specially

utilize magical weapons must collect a number of these crystals.
Mana crystals shatter as soon as they are touched, infusing the

name="The Crusader"><font size="5" face="Garamond"><strong>The
Crusader</strong></font></a></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">In my visions, I have seen four
mismatched heroes who seek to destroy Eidolon. The following
pages chronicle my visions, imparting what I have seen of each. I
know none of their names, but by observing them time and again in
my dreams, I have come to know the heart of each. The first
figure of my visions is a Crusader.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">The Crusader is a holy man and a healer.
Armed with both his faith and an array of mystical weapons, he is
a staunch opponent of Eidolon. His superb defensive skills and
mystical powers make him extremely hardy and resistant, and will
serve him in good stead on his upcoming quest.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Garamond"><strong>Profile of the Crusader<br>
</strong></font><font face="Garamond">Raised in a small,
wind-swept monastery in the southern hills of Blackmarsh, the
Crusader is familiar with hardships of all kinds. He was taken
into the monastery at an early age, after being abandoned by
unknown parents at the monastery&#146;s stone gates. With only
the most barren of surroundings to distract his attention, the
Crusader attacked his studies with the utmost fervor. This
singular lack of distractions has molded a distinct, earnest and
intense personality; few can match his single-minded pursuit of
knowledge, or his remarkable force of will.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">The Crusader was not taught to destroy,
but rather to heal. Healing, however, is sometimes a painful
process: the canker that resists salves and balms must be burned
or excised. As the first year of Eidolon&#146;s reign drew to a
close, the Crusader realized the nature of Thyrion&#146;s blight:
it could not be quelled by peaceful means, but rather must be
driven from the land. To this end he increased his already
rigorous regimen of study, practicing martial skills in addition
to the skills of the healer. </font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">One day, as the Crusader drilled in the
monastery yard with his great Warhammer, the looming figure of a
Golem trudged past the ancient stone gates. Never before had
Eidolon&#146;s minions ventured so far into the countryside. The
Crusader realized that Eidolon had started a new campaign: he
sought to rein in the wayward country folk, driving home his
point by force of arms. The Crusader donned his armor and put
aside his healer&#146;s herbs, knowing the time for action had
finally arrived.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Garamond"><strong>The Crusader&#146;s
Abilities<br>
</strong></font><font face="Garamond">Though not the most
formidable of adversaries, the Crusader has several abilities
that greatly aid his chances of survival. Indeed, the Crusader is
perhaps the hardiest of the four heroes, armed only with the
favor of his god to protect him.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">The Crusader has the power to
periodically heal himself, though this power is not completely
under his own control. As he fights the enemies of Thyrion, he is
constantly learning and gaining insights. It is during his most
intense combats, and hence his most intense periods of learning,
that his body is apt to be completely restored. In this way, the
Crusader&#146;s god rewards action over sloth.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Occasionally, when the Crusader slays an
enemy, a magical sphere appears over the corpse of his foe. This
sphere represents the vitality and power of the enemy. By
collecting this sphere the Crusader is able to partake of his
opponent&#146;s power and add it to his own. For a brief time his
strength is superhuman, and he can perform feats of unlikely
heroism. Eventually this power fades, however, and the Crusader
returns to normal strength.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Garamond"><strong>The Crusader&#146;s
Weapons<br>
</strong></font><font face="Garamond">Though his skills are those
of a healer, the Crusader is nevertheless a formidable opponent.
In my visions I have seen him wielding a wide array of weapons,
and always to good effect.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond"><strong>Warhammer<br>
</strong>The Warhammer is a powerful weapon, and particularly
effective in the Crusader&#146;s capable hands. He swings it with
both speed and power, laying low the minions of Eidolon who dare
to venture close.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">When augmented by the Tome of Power, the
Warhammer is more formidable still. Under the spell of the
magical book, the Crusader can hurl his Warhammer a great
distance, smiting enemies from afar and enshrouding them in a
storm of lightning. The hammer returns to his hands after every
cast, be it hit or miss, passing through obstacles that would
appear to block its return path. </font></p>

size="5" face="Garamond"><strong>The Paladin</strong></font></a></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">The Paladin, like the Crusader, is a
holy man. But while the Crusader is principally a healer, and his
skills emphasize defense, the Paladin is a true warrior. The
favor of his warlike god protects him, but also gives him
strength to smite his foes. </font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Few can match the Paladin in single
combat. He lacks stealth and subtlety, instead relying on his
mighty weapons and divine favor.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Garamond"><strong>Profile of the Paladin<br>
</strong></font><font face="Garamond">The Paladin is a devotee of
Kravnos the War God. The Paladin makes his home in the Great
Temple of Kravnos, in the city of Mur on Septimus. He blesses the
warlike citizens who seek Kravnos&#146; aid, and like his holy
brothers, he rides with the army of Mur whenever the city is
threatened by external forces.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">At the first coming of Eidolon, Mur was
among the first cities to fall. Realizing a quick counterstrike
would not succeed, the devotees of Kravnos took refuge in their
temple. They bided their time and looked for an opportunity to
strike, meanwhile honing their martial skills to a razor-sharp
edge. A fortnight before their attack, however, their secret was
betrayed. An army of Golems and Imps stormed through the temple
at midnight, slaughtering unprepared devotees and destroying the
holy relics of Kravnos. Only the Paladin, meditating in the bell
tower atop the temple, was overlooked.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Cursing the informant who gave them
away, and doubly cursing his brothers&#146; lack of preparation,
the Paladin decided to act immediately. Casting aside the
temple&#146;s carefully-laid plans, he grabbed his mighty sword
and marched on Eidolon&#146;s stronghold. Without a clear plan of
attack, his odds of success seem lean&#150;but as the sole
survivor of his temple, Kravnos will certainly be guiding his
steps from afar.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Garamond"><strong>The Paladin&#146;s
Abilities<br>
</strong></font><font face="Garamond">During endless hours of
training, the Paladin has pushed his abilities to new levels.
Invoking the power of his god, he has developed magical powers
unknown to the common human.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Kravnos the war god has an affinity for
water. As a minion of Kravnos, the Paladin is capable of moving
underwater without the same restrictions as a normal human. While
others are forced to laboriously swim, the Paladin traverses the
depths as if they were air instead of water. When engaged in
battle with a river or lake nearby, he prefers to carry the
battle underwater, where he can use this ability to great
advantage.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">When brought to the brink of death by
his enemies, the Paladin sometimes receives a great boon from
Kravnos. As the lethal blow lands, the Paladin does not die.
Rather, he enters a mystical state: he grows in strength and
stature and becomes a holy scourge, seeking to avenge the
evildoers who tried to lay him low. In this state the Paladin
cannot be killed, and his powers grow to otherwise impossible
heights.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Garamond"><strong>The Paladin&#146;s
Weapons<br>
</strong></font><font face="Garamond">The Paladin&#146;s weapons
emphasize close-range power over long-range projectiles. This
lack of range is sometimes a nuisance, but he often makes up for
this deficiency by closing the gap quickly, and conducting most
combat at comfortably close range.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><strong>Gauntlets<br>
</strong></font><font face="Garamond">The Paladin is a true
fighter, and often likes to use his armored fists as weapons.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Though his Gauntlets may seem a puny
substitute for sword or axe, the Paladin nonetheless is capable
of felling mighty opponents with nothing more than these humble
weapons. </font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">The Tome of Power has a supercharging
effect on the Paladin&#146;s mailed fists, allowing him to knock
foes hither and yon like stuffed playthings, and making it
difficult for them to counterattack.</font></p>

        </strong>The Paladin&#146;s axe is a mighty weapon. In
        addition to its brutal close-range power, the axe casts a
        projectile that ricochets from walls and obstacles. This
        projectile does not stop when it impacts the
        Paladin&#146;s foe, but cuts right through and continues
        flying at lesser strength, potentially damaging several
        foes at once. </font><p><font face="Garamond">The Tome of

width="258" height="400"></strong></font><a name="The Assassin"><font
size="5" face="Garamond"><strong>The Assassin</strong></font></a></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">The Assassin is a master of stealth,
disguise, and trickery. Whereas the Paladin rushes into combat
with a mighty roar, the Assassin sneaks up from behind. Many of
the Assassin&#146;s weapons and skills are geared toward trickery
and concealment. From her devastating ability to backstab an
opponent to the deadly Hand Crossbow, it is clear the Assassin is
always ready for an unfair fight.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Garamond"><strong>Profile of the Assassin<br>
</strong></font><font face="Garamond">The Assassin hails from
Khitar, one of the few true cities in the jungles of Mazaera. As
a child she watched her parents toil as farmers, reaping a meager
harvest from the unforgiving jungle soil. A farmer&#146;s life is
always difficult, but even more so in Mazaera, where the land is
particularly unsuited to the task. The Assassin learned this by
observation, and she learned even more as she prowled the streets
of Khitar&#150;against her parents&#146; wishes. Wealthy folk of
all description wandered those unpaved streets: gem merchants
with stout bodyguards, proud mercenaries bearing gold-hilted
scimitars, and slavers in ivory-trimmed palanquins. None spared a
second glance for an urchin in dirty rags. </font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">As days and years went by, the Assassin
became scornful of her parents. Rich folk gained their wealth by
treading upon the weak, and only weak fools would till the
accursed, clay-filled soil of Mazaera. Vowing never to become a
fool like her parents, she ran away at the age of fifteen and
took up the dark career of the assassin. First preying upon
drunkards and the unwary, she gradually learned the tricks of her
bloody trade, and began to aim for wealthier victims. Her skills
grew by leaps and bounds. Nobody, it seemed, was safe from her
depredations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">With a small fortune accumulated in her
secret lair, the Assassin soon realized she had become bored with
her trade. She required ever richer victims, more and more
danger, to sustain the thrill of the hunt. Who remained that
could pose a challenge? Kings? Emperors? With a crooked smile,
she decided upon her next victim: the richest and most powerful
being on all of Thyrion. Armed with Katar and Crossbow, she set
forth on her quest to rid the world of Eidolon.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Garamond"><strong>The Assassin&#146;s
Abilities<br>
</strong></font><font face="Garamond">The Assassin is a master of
stealth and deadly strikes. The first noteworthy ability the
Assassin gains is that of stealth: she can render herself
invisible when standing perfectly still in a shadowed area. It
takes a few seconds for her to achieve this invisibility, but
once attained, the illusion is perfect. It is rumored that
Assassins can master this skill in broad daylight when their
skills are all but perfected.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">The Assassin makes very little sound
when moving, and is often able to surprise her victims. Creeping
up from behind, she strikes before her foes acknowledge her
presence. When attacking in this fashion, she is capable of
dealing much more damage than she otherwise would. This ability
also comes into play when the Assassin strikes a foe who knows of
her existence, but allows her to get behind him. This is a rare
occurrence, but occasionally significant when she fights sluggish
opponents such as Golems.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Garamond"><strong>The Assassin&#146;s
Weapons<br>
</strong></font><font face="Garamond">The Assassin&#146;s weapons
are excellent for trickery and deception: the Katar is ideal for
vicious backstabbing, her small incendiary Grenades can be lobbed
down at unsuspecting passersby, and her deadly Hand Crossbow is
excellent for picking off foes from afar.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond"><strong>Katar<br>
</strong>The vicious Katar (or &quot;punch dagger&quot;) is the
Assassin&#146;s first weapon. It is the least of her weapons, but
deadly nonetheless. It deals moderate damage at limited range,
and can be wielded very effectively in close quarters. </font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">The Tome of Power imbues the Katar with
a viscous nerve toxin and allows the Assassin to knock back her
enemies with great force. </font></p>

        Crossbow<br>
        </strong>The Hand Crossbow is a trademark weapon of the
        Assassin. Light and portable, yet deadly, the Hand
        Crossbow fires three iron bolts for an added measure of
        destruction. The Assassin likes to employ this weapon
        against distant foes, switching to Katar before closing
        to short range.</font><p><font face="Garamond">The Tome
        of Power magically multiplies the Hand Crossbow&#146;s
        projectiles. Instead of three bolts, five flaming bolts
        are fired from the Hand Crossbow. These bolts stick in
        their target for a moment before exploding for additional
        damage.</font></p>

        Power, the grenades increase in size. Instead of hurling

height="400"></strong></font><a name="The Necromancer"><font
size="5" face="Garamond"><strong>The Necromancer</strong></font></a></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">The Necromancer is a self-styled lord of
the dead. Though physically weak, his potent magic and dark
talents make him a formidable combatant. He likes to fight from a
distance, where his powerful ranged weapons can decimate even the
most formidable of enemies.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Garamond"><strong>Profile of the
Necromancer<br>
</strong></font><font face="Garamond">The Necromancer spent his
early years in a small village of Thysis, huddled in the shadow
of a monolithic pyramid. His people were lean and wiry, but the
Necromancer was thinner and weaker than most. He lived in a
great, cavernous house with only his aunt to mind him, his
parents having died in a plague not long after his birth.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">An unattractive appearance and the lack
of a family conspired against the Necromancer, robbing him of
confidence and making him morbidly self-conscious. His days and
nights were spent inside his aunt&#146;s decaying mansion, and
very rarely did he emerge. He longed for a power&#151;any
power&#151;that would increase his stature in village society. He
wished to be handsome, or strong, or wealthy, or clever in
conversation. But as time wore on, and he grew from a lad to a
young man, it became clear that he possessed none of these
skills.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Bitter and alone, the Necromancer&#146;s
desire for acceptance slowly withered into hatred. He no longer
wished to impress the villagers, but rather, to frighten and
punish them. His thoughts turned to the ancient pyramid that
overshadowed the village. For the villagers, this monument was an
object of superstitious dread. Seeking to partake of that power
and dread, the young Necromancer entered the pyramid.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Within, he found what he sought: a set
of ten crumbling papyrus scrolls, each inked with runes of great
power. Through study and diligence he learned the magic scribed
therein, and soon began to terrorize the village with legions of
undead servitors.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">But the coming of Eidolon quickly ended
his reign of terror. No longer was the Necromancer dreaded by the
villagers; Eidolon and his minions were now the focus of their
dread. The Necromancer, it seemed, was no longer all-powerful.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Bitter and enraged by the helplessness
welling up from within, the Necromancer came to a desperate
conclusion. Eidolon must not be allowed to steal his precious
power. Eidolon must be destroyed! </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Garamond"><strong>The Necromancer&#146;s
Abilities<br>
</strong></font><font face="Garamond">The Necromancer&#146;s
skills are truly unique, and most of them revolve around Soul
Spheres. When the Necromancer slays an opponent, a Soul Sphere is
left behind. This sphere is invisible to all but the Necromancer.
It represents the life force and vitality of the recently-slain
foe. The Necromancer may collect a Soul Sphere simply by touching
it, thus collecting the energy in the form of mana or healing. As
the Necromancer gains skill, his chances of benefiting from a
Soul Sphere slowly increase.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Soul Spheres quickly lose their potency,
so the Necromancer must be swift!</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">The Necromancer&#146;s sickle is also a
source of power. Whenever the Necromancer strikes a foe with this
sickle, he has a chance to drain vitality from his opponent and
add to his own health. This is not a common or predictable
occurrence, but it is often helpful when the Necromancer enters
precarious situations.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Garamond"><strong>The Necromancer&#146;s
Weapons<br>
</strong></font><font face="Garamond">The Necromancer&#146;s
weapons are, for the most part, geared toward long-range attacks.
When used with skill and discretion, they are extraordinarily
effective. </font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond"><strong>Sickle<br>
</strong>The Necromancer&#146;s hand weapon is an iron Sickle.
This is not the most effective of arms, but the Necromancer
favors it as a symbol: like a farmer harvesting wheat, he
relishes the act of harvesting souls with his Sickle. The
Sickle&#146;s power is not entirely symbolic, either:
occasionally the Sickle does harvest vitality from its target,
transferring that vitality to the Necromancer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">The Tome of Power lends both potency and
augmented range to the Necromancer&#146;s Sickle. A fully powered
Sickle knocks enemies from their feet, making it difficult for
them to recover and counterattack.</font></p>
