<p><font face="Garamond">NOTE: Hexen II uses Microsoft </font><a

face="Garamond"> technology, and requires that your system have
the most updated drivers that fully support DirectX.<br>
<br>
In order to play Hexen II for Windows 95, the CD must be in your
CD-ROM drive at all times. <br>
<br>
Hexen II may have trouble working with some 1993 or earlier
Matsushita CD-ROM drives. These CD-ROM drives have trouble
reading beyond 63 minutes on CDs, and Hexen II uses the full CD.
These drives were sold under the names of Panasonic, JVC, Reveal,
Creative Labs and Plextor. Gameplay may occasionally slow down
and the CD-ROM drive will be accessed constantly. We highly
recommend that you upgrade to a newer CD-ROM drive to avoid
problems with other programs in the future.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">To install Hexen II on your
system, insert the game CD into your CD-ROM drive and:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3" face="Garamond">&#149; Double-click on
    Setup.exe at the root level of the CD, or </font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Garamond">&#149; Go to Run&#133; in

</blockquote>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">When the installer splash
screen appears, click on the Install button. For online help,
uninstall, and credits, click the More button.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Note: You can return to this
splash screen any time without affecting your installed game.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">In the Main menu, you can start
a new single-player game by selecting the Single Player option
(press Enter), then selecting New Game and choosing a player
class.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">You can play any of four
different characters in Hexen II, each with his or her own
special set of weapons, abilities, and attributes. Each character
will be able to combat enemies and solve puzzles with varying
degrees of difficulty. For instance, the Paladin may be a strong
fighter but lacks magical powers, while the Assassin can kill
easily but can be killed just as easily. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Playing each character requires
slightly different gameplay styles, but that&#146;s the fun of
Hexen II. Experiment and explore. You&#146;ll be surprised with
the variety between the characters. For more information on each
of the characters, refer to the Chronicle of Deeds.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">The goals in Hexen II are
simple: stay alive, solve the puzzles, and defeat your enemies.
Ultimately, you will face your greatest enemy, Eidolon, but your
journey along the way will be far from easy.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Garamond"><strong>Staying Alive</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><strong>Walking</strong>: Using
the up and down arrow keys will move you forward or backward at a
steady pace. Turn left or right with the left or right arrow keys
or by sliding the mouse in the desired direction.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><strong>Running</strong>: Hold
down the shift key while pressing the arrow keys to increase your
speed.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><strong>Jumping</strong>: Press
the space bar to jump. You jump farther if you&#146;re moving
forward and you jump higher if you&#146;re moving up a slope.
You&#146;ll be surprised at the spots you can reach in a jump.
You can even avoid some attacks this way.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><strong>Swimming</strong>: When
underwater, aim yourself in the direction you wish to go and
press the forward (up arrow) key. You have full three-dimensional
freedom, so use your look-up and look-down keys to swim up and
down. As in real life, you may lose your bearings while
underwater. Use the jump (space) key to kick straight up toward
the surface.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Once on the surface, tread
water by holding down the jump key. To get out of the water, swim
toward the shore and use the jump key to hop out. If you&#146;re
down a well or can&#146;t get a grip, you may not be able to
climb out. There is always another way out, but you may have to
submerge to find it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><strong>Crouching</strong>:
Press the apostrophe key (&#145;) to squeeze into tight areas or
small openings.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><strong>Flying</strong>:
Certain powerups allow you to fly. In addition to your normal
movement keys, use the &#145;D&#146; key to fly up and the
&#145;C&#146; key to fly down.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><strong>Shooting</strong>:
Press the Ctrl key or the left mouse button to fire. Hold shoot
down to keep firing.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><strong>Use</strong>: The Hexen
II key has an automatic &quot;use&quot; function. To push a
button or open a door, walk up to it, or, in some cases, shoot at
it. Remember, some walls can be pushed or pulled. To move these
blocks, simply walk up to them and push in the desired direction.
If a door won&#146;t open or a platform won&#146;t work, you may
need to do something special to activate it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><strong>Picking up Items</strong>:
To pick up items, weapons, power-ups, or armor, simply walk over
them. If you can&#146;t pick something up, it means you already
have the maximum number of that item possible. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><strong>Inventory</strong>:
Throughout the game, you will pick up various powerups and
inventory items. To use an item in your inventory, use your
bracket keys ([ and ]) to toggle between your items and then
press the Enter key to use the selected item. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Garamond"><strong>Solving Puzzles</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><strong>Inventory:</strong>
Throughout the game, you will pick up various puzzle pieces key
to advancing through the game. When you hit the TAB key, you see
small icons of any puzzle pieces you have picked up along the way
and are still carrying. If you need a more detailed description
of your inventory, hit the Q key to show the icons with
descriptions. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><strong>Buttons and Floorplates</strong>:
Buttons activate with a touch, and floorplates must be stepped
on. If you see a distinctive looking button in a spot you cannot
reach, it&#146;s probably a shootable button.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><strong>Hints</strong>:
Throughout the game, there are books, plaques, and signs that can
help you with puzzles. To read these items, simply walk up to
them and read the text that appears on-screen. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><strong>Doors</strong>: Most
doors open at your approach. If one doesn&#146;t, seek a button,
floorplate, key, or inventory item.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><strong>Secret Doors</strong>:
Some doors are camouflaged. Look for irregularities in the walls,
protruding edges, cracks along the walls, etc. Most walls can be
pushed, shot, or triggered with a nearby switch. Likewise, a
switch may be more obvious than the secret door.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><strong>The Secret of Secrets</strong>:
All secrets in Hexen II are indicated by clues. Don&#146;t waste
your time hacking at every wall. It&#146;s much more productive
(and fun) to use your brain and your eyes. Look up. An angled
texture, a light shining under a wall, a strange sound, anything
might be a clue. Something prominent in a room may be a
decoration, or it might be a clue.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Garamond"><strong>Defeating your Enemies</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">There are a wide variety of
enemies in Hexen II that attack in many ways. Some fly, some
crawl, some just swing at you with their stubby arms, but each
requires a slightly different attack to defeat it. If you
can&#146;t hit it with your hands, come back later and defeat it
with a projectile weapon. If you can&#146;t get near it, shoot it
from afar. And when you meet the Four Horsemen and the last of
the Serpent Riders, be sure to have plenty of ammo and health
saved up. You&#146;ll need it!</font></p>

keys. Increasing or decreasing your view area will have a direct
effect on game performance. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Garamond"><strong>The Status Bar<br>
</strong></font><font size="3" face="Garamond">Immediately below
the view area is the Status Bar. Press the Tab key at any time
during the game, and the status bar pops up to reveal much more
information. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Garamond"><strong>The Hub Level System<br>
</strong></font><font size="3" face="Garamond">Hexen II uses a
non-linear hub level system. Each hub consists of several levels.
When you enter a hub, you will solve the various puzzles and
defeat the enemies that lead you to the Hub Room. From this room,
you access any of several teleporters that take you to other
levels of the hub. Solve those levels and return to the Hub Room.
Once all the levels in a hub are complete, you can move on to the
next hub.</font></p>

Trouble-Shooting and Reference Guide</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond"><strong>The Engine<br>
</strong>Hexen II (H2) is based on the WinQuake, the a native
Win32 application, and will run on either Win95 or Windows NT 4.0
or later. Note that this engine is different from the GL version,
&quot;Glh2.exe,&quot; included with this game, and that the
references in this section of the Tech Help document do not apply
to Glh2. </font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">H2 is designed to take advantage of
whatever enhanced video, sound, and input capabilities (such as
DirectX or VESA VBE video modes) are present, but has fallback
functionality so it can run on any Win95 or NT 4.0 or later
system, even if neither DirectX nor VESA VBE is available. You
may experience problems running H2 on some systems, because video
driver and operating-system support for game functionality are
not yet mature under Win32, and many bugs and incompatibilities
remain in those components. If you encounter what seems to be a
bug, first please check through the list of known problems, </font><a
href="#Common Problems and Workarounds"><font color="#FF0000"
face="Garamond">below</font></a><font color="#000000"
face="Garamond">, and check to see that your problem is not
covered in this </font><a href="#Home"><font color="#000000"
face="Garamond">manual</font></a><font face="Garamond">. If your
problem doesn't appear in this documentation, please contact
Online customer support at </font><a
href="http://www.idsoftware.com/support"><font face="Garamond">http://www.idsoftware.com/support</font></a><font
face="Garamond">. </font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond"><strong>Hexen II Modes<br>
</strong>Hexen II supports several modes. Double clicking the
H2.exe icon will launch the game in normal mode. To launch the
game in a special mode, you need to execute a batch file called
&quot;H2B.bat&quot; found in the Hexen II directory from a MS-DOS
prompt. To do this, go to your Start Menu, open the Programs
folder, and select the MS-DOS Prompt icon. Switch directories
(&quot;cd..&quot; to go up a level, &quot;cd hexeni~1&quot; to go
into the Hexen II folder [DOS truncates the folder name to 8
characters with the &quot;~1&quot;]) to the Hexen II folder, and
type any of the commands below.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Garamond">The first special mode
Hexen II supports is</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Garamond">H2B fast</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Garamond">(The &quot;b&quot;
stands for Batch) This is the same as typing &quot;h2&quot;; this
runs Hexen II in an aggressive configuration that is likely to
yield the best performance if it runs successfully on your
system, but which has a risk of causing Hexen II or even your
system to crash if there are bugs or incompatibilities in your
video or sound drivers. Alternatively, you can use</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Garamond">H2B safe</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Garamond">to run Hexen II in a
conservative configuration, likely to run on almost all machines
with no problems, but possibly with slower graphics, fewer
high-resolution modes, and delayed sound. Or you can run</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Garamond">H2B verysafe</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Garamond">to run Hexen II in a
very conservative configuration that is pretty much guaranteed to
run, but will probably have slow performance, and will have no
sound. Two other options are</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Garamond">H2B fastvid</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Garamond">which has maximum video
performance, but greater sound latency (delay until the sound is
heard), and</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Garamond">H2B fastsnd</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Garamond">which uses more
conservative video modes, but low-latency sound.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Garamond">(One odd note is that
DirectSound has much lower-latency sound than wave sound, but is
currently quite a bit slower overall. Thus you may find that
&quot;H2B fastvid&quot; is actually faster, by as much as 5-10%,
than &quot;H2B fast&quot;; however, it may not feel faster,
because the sound will lag.)</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Garamond">Finally, you can use</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000000" face="Garamond">H2B max</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Garamond">which is the same as H2B
fast, but turns on DirectInput, which provides more responsive
mouse control, but does not work properly on all systems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">By default, Hexen II will install </font><a
href="#DirectX 3a"><font face="Garamond">DirectX 3a</font></a><font
face="Garamond"> on your system. Note, however, that DirectX is
not required for H2 to run, but H2 will automatically take
advantage of DirectSound and DirectDraw if they are present. If
DirectSound is no longer present for some reason, there will
generally be considerable sound latency (sound will become
audible several hundred milliseconds after the event that caused
it). Note also that there are currently no true DirectSound
drivers for Windows NT, so H2 will always run using wave output
on NT, and will consequently have lagged sound. See </font><a
href="#DirectX 3a"><font face="Garamond">below</font></a><font
face="Garamond"> for information about obtaining DirectX if you
do not have it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Note that VESA VBE modes aren't required
for H2 to run, but H2 will automatically make VESA modes
available if they're present. Your BIOS may already have VESA VBE
2.0 support built in, but most BIOSes don't. Worse, some BIOSes
do have VESA VBE 2.0 built-in, but have buggy implementations,
which may prevent you from being able to run the faster
configurations of H2. </font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond"><strong>Heapsize (Memory Allocation)<br>
</strong>Hexen II normally uses half the physical memory in your
system for its heap, but not less than 12 Mb and not more than 22
Mb. You can override this with &quot;-heapsize n&quot;, where n
is the amount of memory to allocate for the heap, in</font><font
color="#000000" face="Garamond"> Kb. For instance, you would type
&quot;-heapsize 16000&quot; to use 16 Mb of RAM.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond"><strong>Joysticks<br>
</strong>To use the joystick, you must bring down the console by
pressing the tilde ('~') key, and type &quot;joystick
1&lt;enter&gt;&quot;; you can disable the joystick with
&quot;joystick 0&lt;enter&gt;&quot; at any time. The joystick
setting remains in effect for subsequent Hexen II sessions until
changed, so you only need to do joystick 1 once to enable the
joystick. If the joystick somehow causes problems that keep you
from being able to run Hexen II at all, you can start Hexen II
-nojoy to complete disable the joystick for that session.</font></p>

from action to hearing the sound), may result in fewer or slower
high-res video modes, and the mouse may be somewhat less

quick fixes. Often, the problem is caused by incompatible or
buggy DirectX drivers or code (later installations of DirectX
could cause this), and can frequently be fixed completely simply
by reinstalling the supplied version of Microsoft DirectX 3a
which can be found on your game CD in the DirectX folder. Also,
you can find these drivers on the </font><a

although the availability and location of the DirectX file
changes periodically; note that at last check, this is a 3.4 Mb
file. (Be aware, though, that sometimes Microsoft's DirectX
drivers don't support features that the manufacturers' drivers do
support, such as display refresh rate control.) For more

<p><font face="Garamond">One known problem of this sort involves
the current SB16 drivers from Creative Labs, which cause H2 to
crash on some machines. The DirectSound drivers from Microsoft,
available via the above-mentioned </font><a

problem.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">It can also sometimes help to get the
latest Windows drivers for your video adapter or sound card
(although as the SB16 example indicates, this is not always a
good idea), and for video boards that have flash BIOSes, it can
sometimes help to get the latest BIOS upgrade.</font></p>

<p><a name="H2 sometimes runs pretty slowly fullscreen"><font
face="Garamond"><strong>H2 sometimes runs pretty slowly
fullscreen<br>
</strong></font></a><font face="Garamond">There are several
possible reasons for this, starting with &quot;You have a slow
computer.&quot; Assuming that's not the case, you can sometimes
get a faster 320x200 mode on Win95 by doing vid_describemodes,
then using vid_mode to select a non-VGA 320x200 mode, as
described in the &quot;</font><a
href="#A bit about how H2 video works"><font color="#FF0000"
face="Garamond">A bit about how H2 video works</font></a><font
face="Garamond">&quot; section.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">You can also try using a primary sound
buffer on Win95 (this doesn't work on NT) by using the
-primarysound command-line switch; this can improve performance
by several percent, but does not work on all systems, and can
result in odd sound effects on some systems when minimizing H2 or
switching the focus away from it. Finally, you can use -wavonly
to select wave sound; this will increase your sound latency
(sounds will be heard later than they should), but allows H2 to
run 5-10% faster on some systems. That's about all you can do to
speed up fullscreen H2 on Win95, other than shrinking the active
area of the screen with the screen size control in the Options
menu.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">NT 4.0 comes with DirectX installed, but
doesn't have any resolutions lower than 640x480. In order to
support a lower-resolution 320x240 mode, H2 has NT double each
pixel in both directions to get enough pixels for 640x480. The
extra stretching costs some performance, the result being that NT
can seem sluggish on all but high-end Pentiums and Pentium Pros.
(In fact, depending on the quality of your driver's stretching
code, it can sometimes be faster to run H2 at 640x480 than
320x240-stretched on NT.) One thing that can help on NT is
switching to 640x480, then using the Options menu to shrink the
active area of the screen.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">A common cause of slowness running in a
window is having the desktop run in 16- or 32-bpp mode. H2 is an
8-bpp application, and it slows things down if pixels have to be
translated from 8-bpp to 16- or 32-bpp. (Note that this is
generally a problem only when running in a window; fullscreen
apps rarely suffer from this.)</font></p>

lets H2 change all 256 colors, so when a palette flash happens,

DirectDraw currently doesn't allow changing black; likewise, on

normal window or fullscreen. Consequently, in some modes and in a
window, some parts of the H2 screen stay black when the palette
flashes. There is no workaround.</font></p>

currently not a fully shareable resource on Win32. Consequently,
while H2 is running, it always has the sound hardware allocated

This means that normally (when H2 is using DirectSound), apps
that use wave sound (most non-game apps) will not be able to play
sound while H2 is running, even if H2 is minimized or not the
active app, although other DirectSound apps will be able to play
sound when H2 is not the active app. If H2 is using wave sound
rather than DirectSound (either because -wavonly is used on the
command line, or because there is no DirectSound driver, as is
always the case on NT), then no other app will be able to play
any sound while H2 is running, period.</font></p>

have to work around it by remembering to let go of Tab first.</font></p>

<p><a name="A bit about how H2 video works"><font size="4"
face="Garamond"><strong>A bit about how H2 video works </strong></font></a></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">H2 has the built-in ability to draw into
windows (both normal, framed desktop windows and fullscreen,
borderless windows). It also has built- in support for VGA
320x200 graphics, and supports DirectDraw, VESA VBE 2.0 and VESA
VBE/AF (Accelerator Functions) graphics modes, if those are
available.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">H2 does not require VESA VBE, but in
order for VESA VBE modes to be available, your graphics card must
be VESA VBE 2.0 or VBE/AF compliant; a VESA driver can either be
built into the BIOS of your graphics card, or loadable via
software. Contact the original manufacturer of your video card to
obtain software updates containing these drivers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond"><strong>Video modes supported in Win95<br>
</strong>What all this means is that on Win95, H2 will always be
able to run in the following modes:</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">1) in a window</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">2) fullscreen 320x200 VGA mode 0x13</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">3) fullscreen high-resolution of some
sort</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Category #3 can be any of several
configurations. On Win95, if either DirectDraw or VESA VBE modes
are available, then all the DirectDraw and VESA modes will be
presented as high-res choices. (320x200 will always default to
VGA mode 0x13.) In the case that a given resolution is supported
by both DirectDraw and VESA, the VESA mode will be used.
(However, the command-line switch -nowindirect can turn off VESA
modes entirely.) If neither DirectDraw nor VESA modes are
available, then high-resolution modes will be provided by using
fullscreen, borderless windows in whatever resolutions the
Windows driver supports, usually starting at 640x480 and going
up.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Garamond"><strong>Video Modes Supported in Windows
NT<br>
</strong>NT is similar but not identical, because neither VESA
VBE modes nor VGA mode 0x13 are available. On NT, H2 will always
be able to run in the following modes:</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">1) in a window</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">2) fullscreen high-resolution of some
sort</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">On NT, category #2 can be one of two
configurations. If DirectDraw modes are available, then those
will be the high-res choices; otherwise, fullscreen, borderless
windows will be used in whatever resolutions the driver supports,
usually starting at 640x480 and going up. Because there is
normally no low-resolution mode such as 320x200 or 320x240 on NT,
a pseudo low-res mode is created by rendering at 320x240, then
stretching the image by doubling it in each direction while
copying it to a 640x480 screen. However, stretching performance
depends on the driver, and can be slow, so sometimes 640x480 is
actually faster than 320x240 on NT.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">The bottom line here is that you can
generally just use the Video menu and pick one of the modes and
be happy. In some cases, though, you may need to use command-line
switches (described next) to get the types of modes you want. One
useful tip is to go into the console and do vid_describemodes,
which lists all the modes H2 makes available on your machine
given the command-line switches you've used. Each mode is
followed by the name of the internal H2 driver that supports it,
so you can tell which modes are DirectDraw, VESA, and so on, as
follows:</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">WINDOWED: H2 runs in a normal window</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">FULLSCREEN DIB: fullscreen borderless
window</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">FULLSCREEN VGA8.DRV: VGA 320x200 mode</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">FULLSCREEN DDRAW8.DRV: DirectDraw mode</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">FULLSCREEN LINEAR8.DRV: VESA VBE 2.0+
mode</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">FULLSCREEN ACCEL8.DRV: VESA VBE/AF
(Accelerator Functions) mode</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">(note that H2 does not take advantage of
VBE/AF acceleration; so far as H2 is concerned VBE/AF is the same
as normal VBE)</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">You can use vid_mode from the console to
set any of these modes. So, for example, if you see that there
are two 320x200 modes (such as one VGA mode 0x13, normally mode
3, and one VESA mode, normally mode 4), you can choose the VESA
mode, which will often be faster, with vid_mode 4. (You can make
it the default by setting _vid_default_mode_win to the mode
number.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">There's more to the windowed modes than
you might think. 320x240 is just what you&#146;d expect, but
640x480 is actually rendered at 320x240 and stretched up to
640x480, because most machines can&#146;t handle the performance
demands of real 640x480 rendering. Likewise, 800x600 is a
stretched 400x300. Actually, though, vid_mode 2 (the 800x600
mode) is a user-configurable mode. By setting the following
console variables, you can change the characteristics of vid_mode
2:</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">vid_config_x: width of mode 2 window</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">vid_config_y: height of mode 2 window</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">vid_stretch_by_2: whether to render at
half-resolution in each direction and stretch up to the specified
size in mode 2, or render at full resolution.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">After setting these variables in the
console, do a vid_forcemode 2, and you&#146;ll have the window
you specified. Note that after making these changes, the new
resolution will show up as the third windowed mode in the Video
menu.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">You can turn off page flipping by
setting the console variable vid_nopageflip to 1, then setting a
new mode. (Note that the vid_nopageflip setting does not take
effect until the next mode set.) Some systems run faster with
page flipping turned off; also, page flipping does not work
properly on some adapters, and vid_nopageflip is a workaround for
this. Note that vid_nopageflip is a persistent variable; it
retains its setting until it is explicitly changed again, even
across multiple Hexen II sessions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">The vid_forcemode console command sets
the specified mode, even if it's the same as the current mode
(normally the mode set only happens if the new mode differs from
the current mode). This is generally useful only if you've
modified the characteristics of video mode 2 (the configurable
window) while you're in mode 2, and want to force the new
characteristics to take effect.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Whenever you switch to running Hexen II
in a window, the window is placed at the same location it was in
the last time Hexen II ran in a window. You can reset the window
position to the upper left by using the -resetwinpos command-line
switch. The window position is stored in the vid_window_x and
vid_window_y console variables.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4" face="Garamond"><strong>Video command-line
switches<br>
</strong></font><font face="Garamond">The full list of
video-related command-line switches is:</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">-dibonly: H2 will use only windows (both
normal, framed windows on the desktop and fullscreen, borderless
windows), not any direct hardware access modes such as DirectDraw
or VESA modes, or even VGA 320x200 mode. This is the closest
thing to a guaranteed-to-run fullscreen mode H2 has.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">-nowindirect: H2 will not try to use
VESA VBE 2.0 modes, or VBE/AF 1.0 or later modes. Note that if
there are both DirectDraw and VESA modes for a given resolution,
H2 will normally use the VESA mode; -nowindirect allows
DirectDraw modes to be the preferred choice for all resolutions
except 320x200. This can be useful if H2 is crashing because of a
buggy VESA driver.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">-nodirectdraw: H2 will not try to use
DirectDraw modes. This can be useful if H2 is crashing because of
a buggy DirectDraw driver.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">-novbeaf: H2 will not try to use VBE/AF
1.0 or later modes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">-startwindowed: H2 will come up in a
windowed mode, without going fullscreen even during
initialization.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">-noforcevga: normally, H2 uses VGA mode
0x13 for the default 320x200 mode, even if a DirectDraw or VESA
320x200 mode exists. However, DirectDraw and VESA modes can be
considerably faster than mode 0x13, because they can set up a
linear framebuffer with higher memory bandwidth. If you specify
-noforcevga, the default 320x200 mode in the menu will be a
DirectDraw or VESA mode if one exists. This has no effect on
modes selected via the console variable vid_mode, and if 320x200
is already your video mode, -noforcevga doesn't do anything until
you use the menu to select another mode, then select 320x200
again. (So if your default mode is 320x200 and you then specify
-noforcevga, switch away to some other mode and then back to
320x200 to get the potentially faster 320x200 mode.) The downside
to this switch is that DirectDraw and VESA modes can cause
problems in some systems, due to driver bugs or hardware
incompatibilities; if you experience problems with this switch,
don't use it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">-noautostretch: don't stretch windowed
modes selected with -startwindowed to double resolution.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">-nofulldib: don't use fullscreen,
borderless windows, even if there are no DirectDraw or VESA modes
available.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">-allow360: allow listing of 360-wide
modes in the video mode menu. These are normally filtered out to
make sure the menu doesn't get too full, which could cause
high-res modes not to be displayed.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4" face="Garamond"><strong>A bit about how H2
sound works<br>
</strong></font><font face="Garamond">H2 can use either
DirectSound or Windows wave output to generate sound. If
DirectSound is available, it is used; if not, if wave sound is
available it is used; and if neither is available, there is no
sound. DirectSound results in the best sound quality, and also
the lowest-latency sound; use it if you can, because you will be
happier with the results. (Note, though, that no NT sound drivers
yet support DirectSound.) Wave sound will often have high
latency, lagging the events that generate sound by hundreds of
milliseconds on some machines.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">You can tell what kind of sound H2 uses
on your system by looking at the startup portion of the console;
you will see either &quot;DirectSound initialized&quot; or
&quot;Wave sound initialized&quot; (neither message is printed if
there's no sound). Any sound failure messages will also be
printed in the startup portion of the console.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Note that H2 generates sound only when
it is the active app, the one with the input focus.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4" face="Garamond"><strong>Sound command-line
switches<br>
</strong></font><font face="Garamond">The full list of
sound-related command-line switches is:</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">-wavonly: don&#146;t use DirectSound,
but use wave sound if available. Note that wave sound is
generally faster than DirectSound, but has considerably greater
latency. This switch is redundant on NT, because all sound output
on current NT drivers is wave sound.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">-nosound: don&#146;t output any sound.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">-primarysound: use DirectSound primary
buffer output. This is generally faster than normal secondary
buffer output, but does not work in some systems, and produces
odd sound glitches on minimization and focus switching in other
systems. Use it at your own risk, and please do not report sound
bugs if you're using this switch.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">-snoforceformat: H2 will not try to
force the sound hardware to 11 KHz, 16 bits per sample. This may
be useful if DirectSound is failing for no apparent reason, but
generally H2 will produce better sound and better performance if
this switch is not used.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4" face="Garamond"><strong>Notes on networking<br>
</strong></font><font face="Garamond">The winsock TCP/IP driver
will not cause a dial-up internet connection to automatically
start up when Quake is started. If you start Quake with it
inactive, the connection will be activated when you either try to
connect to a server or search for local servers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">The local IP address will not always be
known at startup. If it is currently unknown the menu will
display &quot;INADDR_ANY&quot;. This will be replaced with the
real address when it is known. The IP address will become known
when you try to connect to a server, you search for local
servers, or you start a server.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">For multi-homed machines (machines with
more than one network adapter and IP adress), you can force Hexen
II to bind to a specific IP address. There is a command line
option &quot;-ip&quot; that takes an IP address as its parameter.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4" face="Garamond"><strong>Notes on the mouse</strong></font><font
face="Garamond"><br>
If DirectInput is installed and functioning, Hexen II can use it
for mouse input, but does not do so automatically because
DirectInput does not work properly on all systems. DirectInput
can be enabled via the command-line switch -dinput. If
DirectInput is not available or is not enabled, Hexen II uses the
normal Windows mouse APIs instead. DirectInput provides slightly
smoother motion; also, it tends to be more responsive to fast
spinning motions, and we recommend that you use it if it works
properly on your system. You can determine if H2 uses DirectInput
on your system when you use -dinput by checking for
&quot;DirectInput initialized&quot; in the startup console text.
If not, you might try installing DirectX 3 (note, though, that as
I write this there is no released DirectInput support for Windows

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">The hardware world is changing
so fast that it is impossible for us to test, or even list, every
3D accelerator card with GLHexen. While some cards work extremely
well, we cannot guarantee that your card will work as expected.</font><font
face="Garamond"> </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><b>How GL Works:</b></font><font
face="Garamond"> <br>
</font><font size="3" face="Garamond">The executable relies on
the OpenGL library created by 3Dfx to support their Voodoo
graphics cards. If you have a non-Voodoo graphics board that
fully supports OpenGL, you can try removing the file Opengl32.dll
from the Hexen II directory. This will force the program to use
the GL library installed with your card's drivers. However, there
are no guarantees that this will work.</font><font
face="Garamond"> </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">If you are using a Voodoo
graphics board and are still having trouble getting GLHexen
working, we suggest reinstalling your manufacturer's run-time
Glide drivers (not the Direct3D drivers if there is an option
between the two). Click </font><a

<p><a name="DirectX 3a"><font size="5" face="Garamond"><strong>DirectX
3a</strong></font></a></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Upon completion of the Hexen II setup,
the installation process will continue by determining if
Microsoft DirectX 3a needs to be installed on your computer. If
so, the Microsoft DirectX 3a setup program will install the
appropriate files on your computer. If you choose not to install
DirectX 3a, and you find that later you need to install DirectX
3a, follow these directions. With the Hexen II disc in your
CD-ROM drive, install Microsoft DirectX 3a by right mouse
clicking on the Hexen II CD icon to get the Context menu. From
that menu, select Install DirectX.<br>
<br>
<strong>Who makes DirectX and how can I contact them?<br>
</strong></font><a href="http://www.microsoft.com"><font
face="Garamond">Microsoft</font></a><font face="Garamond">
created </font><a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/default.asp"><font
face="Garamond">DirectX</font></a><font face="Garamond">. If the
answer to the question you are looking for is not found on this
page, you may want to contact Microsoft via mail at:<br>
<br>
Microsoft Customer Sales and Service<br>
One Microsoft Way<br>
Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA<br>
<br>
Microsoft can also be reached in the USA at (800) 426-9400, or
internationally at +1(206) 882-8080.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>What is DirectX and why do I need it?<br>
</strong>Microsoft's DirectX 3a is an API (Application
Programming Interface) set that increases the speed at which
games play under the Windows 95 operating system. These APIs
allow direct access to the enhanced features of hardware under
Windows 95. With DirectX 3a, a program has instant access to the
hardware, allowing for great advances in graphics, sound, video,
3-D, and network capabilities of games.<br>
<br>
Since Windows 95 and DirectX 3a are relatively new in the
computer world and have not achieved compatibility with some
older video cards, many manufacturers are releasing updated
drivers for Windows 95 to meet the DirectX standard. If you are
not sure about your video card's compatibility, consult the
company that makes your video card.<br>
<br>
If the Microsoft DirectX Installer does not detect DirectX 3a on
your computer, it can install DirectX 3a for you. After
installation is complete, you will need to restart your computer
in order for DirectX 3a to take effect.<br>
<br>
If you have other Windows 95 games on your computer, chances are
you already have an earlier version of DirectX installed on your
computer. In this case, the Microsoft Installer will overwrite
that version with DirectX 3a. The DirectX installation process
will then be complete. You will need to restart your computer for
the changes to take effect.<br>
<br>
If you already have DirectX 3a installed on your computer, the
Microsoft DirectX 3a installer will detect it and not overwrite
any DirectX 3a files. You will not need to restart your computer
after installation in order to run Hexen II.<br>
<br>
DirectX 3a should not affect any titles designed for the original
version of DirectX. Should you encounter difficulties with
DirectX 3a, please contact Microsoft for further information. <br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>How do I check to see if my computer supports DirectX?<br>
</strong>1. Place the disc in the CD-ROM drive and exit from any
AutoPlay screens.<br>
2. Double-click on &quot;My Computer&quot;.<br>
3. Right-click on your CD-ROM drive and choose Install DirectX.<br>
<br>
If any of the components of DirectX are not certified, please
call your hardware manufacturer for the updated drivers that
support DirectX.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>I am having problems with running Hexen II and think it
might be related to my Direct X installation. What should I do?<br>
</strong>If you experience problems running Hexen II, try turning
off the &quot;Enable 3D Acceleration&quot; option in the DirectX
setup program. To disable 3D Acceleration, double click on the
dxsetup icon located in Program Files\DirectX\Setup. Uncheck the
option for 3D acceleration in the middle of the DXSetup window.<br>
<br>
<strong>I have heard DirectX is not compatible with some video
cards. What can you tell me about that?<br>
</strong>Windows 95 and DirectX are relatively new in the
computer world and have not achieved compatibility with some
older video cards. Many manufacturers are releasing updated
drivers to meet the DirectX standard. If you are not sure about
your video card's compatibility, consult the Vendor List for the
company that makes your video card.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>If I don't have DirectX, will Hexen II install it for me?</strong><br>
Yes. If the Microsoft DirectX Installer does not detect DirectX
on your computer, it will install DirectX for you. After
installation is complete, you will need to restart your computer
in order for DirectX to take effect.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>If the DirectX Installer copied over a previous version,
will the UnInstaller remove DirectX 3a? How will this affect my
other Windows 95 games?</strong><br>
DirectX 3a will remain on your computer and you will be able to
run other Windows 95 games that use Microsoft&#146;s DirectX
libraries. DirectX 3a should not affect any titles designed for
the original version of DirectX. Should you encounter
difficulties with DirectX 3a, please contact Microsoft for
further information (address and phone number listed above).<br>
<br>
How do I restore my video and/or audio drivers once DirectX has
been installed?<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Place the disc in the CD-ROM drive and exit from any AutoPlay
screens.<br>
2. Double-click on &quot;My Computer&quot;.<br>
3. Right-click on your CD-ROM drive and choose Install DirectX.<br>
<br>
<br>
Choose the button that satisfies your need (e.g. Restore Audio
drivers). This process will install your previous drivers and
prompt you to restart Microsoft Windows.<br>
<br>
The following manufacturers suggest running DirectX 3a with their
products using the configurations listed below. If you need
further assistance, please contact your video card manufacturer
directly.<br>

drivers. Instructions are as follows:<br>
<br>
1. Place the game disc in the CD-ROM drive and exit from any
AutoPlay screens.<br>

3. Right-click on your CD-ROM drive and choose Install DirectX.<br>
4. Click on the button labeled &#147;Restore Video drivers.&#148;<br>
